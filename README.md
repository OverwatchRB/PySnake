                                         """ THE INFAMOUS SNAKE GAME """

Designed and implemented a clone of the classic Snake Game using Python's Tkinter library for the front-end and canvas for animations. This project features smooth snake movement, collision detection, and responsive controls. Future enhancements include variations such as randomizing the snake's position after each bite and introducing a fake fruit that decreases the snake's length. These potential additions aim to diversify gameplay and increase the game's challenge and replayability.
